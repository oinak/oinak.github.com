  "No Spam" by David Hegarty
</a>



Yesterday I came across "Dan Pollock's page about hosts":http://someonewhocares.org/ and I decided to try it.

First of all I was impacted by how many sites I read daily were affected. Then I was disappointed because I
was __noticing__ *the lack of ads* at every place I saw the "Counldn't connect" notice. This was the exact
opposite of the initial purpose.

The problem is that I had my brain already trained to avoid most of the ads, but not to avoid missing web
resources. As I spend most of my computer time on Web development enabled machines, I almost always have a 
webserver on. This came to my rescue in the form of a catchall location on my nginx configuration that picks
every request to localhost that is not a previously configured location, and sets a discrete and visually
avoidable 404 error page for all of them.

In case you feel tempted to follow my steps, here you have my setup:

At _/opt/nginx/sites-available/spam-eater_:

<pre>
<code>
    server {
        listen          80 default_server;
        server_name     _;
        error_page      404 = /index.html;
        index           index.html;
        root            /path/to/no_ads;
    }
</code>
</pre>

At _/path/to/no_ads_:

<pre>
<code>
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="es">
    <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>No ads</title>
    </head>
    <body>
    No ads today :-)
    </body>
    </html>
</code>
</pre>
