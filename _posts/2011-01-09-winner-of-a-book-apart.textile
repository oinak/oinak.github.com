Just as I announced, I have randomly picked up one of the (couple of) tweets opting to win the copy of "HTML5 FOR WEB DESIGNERS":http://books.alistapart.com/products/html5-for-web-designers

I could have used a coin but for rules sake I used the stated method:

So the fisrt of the tweets was the winner, and this was: "@Wepwawet's":http://twitter.com/Wepwawet/status/22625854861344768

Soon some pics of the prize handing.

There will be a second prize of a Friendly Neighbourly Beer for all the other participants (namely: "@supersonik86":http://twitter.com/supersonik86) you will be contacted about this :D
