p(meta). 09 Jan 2011 - Madrid (UPDATED: 18 ene 2011)

Just as I announced, I have randomly picked up one of the (couple of) tweets opting to win the copy of "HTML5 FOR WEB DESIGNERS":http://books.alistapart.com/products/html5-for-web-designers

I could have used a coin but for rules sake I used the stated method:

So the fisrt of the tweets was the winner, and this was: "@Wepwawet's":http://twitter.com/Wepwawet/status/22625854861344768

-Soon some pics of the prize handing.-

UPDATE: Look at the face of the happy winner!
