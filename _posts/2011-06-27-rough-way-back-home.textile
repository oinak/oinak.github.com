I spent this last weekend kicking ubuntu off my laptop and devoting it to a significantly less sinful Debian Squeeze. 

Not that there is anything wrong with Ubuntu. It works wonderful on my machine. It is just that I had the spare time, and the wish to feel crafty. It has been a very rewarding experience. every bit of manual tuning, of unautomatic setup and of diminished ""it-just-works-iness" have broguht me back to my college years when Knopper was all we had and console mplayer full screen was awesome enought to spent an evening.

Sometimes you do not prefer the easiest tool, sometimes you want to trade some comfort for power, or for the pleasure of some pleasing kind of work.

Yesterday was one of those times.
