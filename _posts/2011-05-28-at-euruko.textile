p(meta). 28-29 Mar 2011 - Berlin

After a very negative experience with "@amiando":http://twitter.com/amiando during the process of trying to get a ticket for "euruko 2011":http://euruko2011.org I had the luck that my former coworker "@dias_jorge":http://twitter.com/dias_jorge who got a ticket but was finally unable to go.

Euruko was a wonderful experience an a great example to take notes from regarding the next "Conferencia Rails":http://conferenciarails.org. 
Berlin is a very wellcoming city where I felt a great envy for the bike friendly streets and infrastructures. The venue was a big win in many asects the incredible screen and very comfortable seats accounted for the scarce power lines let alone the very good wifi signal they secured throught some antenna-jutsu.

I will try to ensure my tickets next year, and reproduce this very positive experience, but not the unnecesary emtion of not having tickets til last moment.
