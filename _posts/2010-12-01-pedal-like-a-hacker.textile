p(meta). 01 Dec 2010 - Madrid

If you feel like or want to become a _hacker_, in the good sense (someone who makes things work beyond perceived limits in a clever way), here is a free tip for you, here it goes:

p(((. _Own, ride and repair your own bike_

p. Here are some quick reasons
* It is a simple mechanism to learn and comprehend
* All componentes are at plain sight
* Every part is replaceable and/or easy to modify or repair

p. It is in the spirit of the "Craftmanship":http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Craftsmanship.html and helps you tou conceive the workings of a system composed of multiple parts, yet simple enough to keep it in mind and to not become a burden. Do you remember the '_Know and maintain your own tool_', your programming language/framework does not have anything to do with wheels, brakes, pumps etc. but it DOES have to do with parts interacting, with standards that allow a part to be replaced, with tuning to one's needs for improving performance and so on.

In case you don't see my philosophical point&hellip;

p. Here are some not hackerdom related reasons
* It's healthier to cycle-commute if you can
* and cheaper
* and greener

The sign reads: 'I love cycling to work' over Madrid's every morning traffic jam.

h2. Lame excuses you shouldn't be making any more and the reasons you shoundn't

- I will be late to work := I pedal about 20km (12.42 miles) round trip every day to work in a sloppy city like Madrid and I still win my car-driving friend on a similar distance by some minutes.

- I will stink := Slower pace, deodorant, soap, a towel and extra clothes, modern miracles that fit in a back pack

- I don't know how to repair a bike := "Come on!":http://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+to+bike

- I am afraid of the traffic := Then ride in a "safe way":http://bicyclesafe.com/

- My work place is too far away := Combine a foldable bike with public transport

- My work is too close/I telecommute := Pedal during part of the two hours you _aren't_ driving to work ;-)
