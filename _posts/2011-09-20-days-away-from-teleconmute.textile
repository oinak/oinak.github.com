I am going to work from home!

Just as I did as an experiment on August, and for three days each week.

This is quite a milestone, not just for the comfort and the fuel save.

Spain is a place known for people avoiding work, bosses that keep you endless hours in which you try to work
the least, and other office roguedom (is that even a word?) stories. This is an old and sad image, but it has
deep roots into our national idiosyncrasy. Work is not usually measured nor paid by achievements, but for
time spent. It is a bad message tha leads to horrendous results.

I consider that developing the trust relation with your employer that allows you to do your thing out of their
sight is the first step in the path of not being _stopclocked_ while you work. I would like to (and hope to
someday) work in a purely goal-targeted manner. Code is not sausages, you don't always get as much done in
the same amount of time. This is not a new thing, freelancers know it well, however they pay a high price
('free' as in "no one gives a shit if you end up broke") for that freedom.
